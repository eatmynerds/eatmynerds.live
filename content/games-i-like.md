I grew up playing this on my Xbox 360 so it's definitely one of my top games.

### Minecraft

I have a special love for the Xbox 360 Edition of the game, but I also love playing the Java Edition.

### Left 4 Dead 2

One of my favorites, I love everything the soundtrack, the characters, and the voice acting.
