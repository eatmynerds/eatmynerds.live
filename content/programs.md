Here are some of my favorite and most-used programs.

### [QBitTorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)
A fast, lightweight, and ad-free BitTorrent client that works everywhere.

### [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
My go-to text editor, I use it on basically everything.

### [Lobster](https://github.com/justchokingaround/lobster)
A simple and effective command-line tool for watching movies and tv series directly in your terminal. It's a great complement to ani-cli for everything that isn't anime.

### [Ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli)
An essential script for any anime fan who likes the terminal. It lets you find, watch, and download your favorite shows with a few simple commands. It's fast, efficient, and makes watching anime incredibly convenient.
